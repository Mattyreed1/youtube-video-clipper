# YouTube Video Clipper

YouTube Video Clipper is a powerful tool that downloads YouTube videos and extracts multiple clips from them based on specified timestamps. Perfect for creating social media content, highlights, or short clips from longer videos.

## What is YouTube Video Clipper?

YouTube Video Clipper allows you to:
- Download any YouTube video
- Extract multiple clips with precise timestamps
- Generate thumbnails automatically
- Get direct download URLs for clips and thumbnails
- Handle various video qualities and formats

All you need is a YouTube URL and a list of timestamps for the clips you want to extract.

## How to use YouTube Video Clipper?

YouTube Video Clipper is designed to be user-friendly and straightforward:

1. **Create a free Apify account** using your email
2. **Open YouTube Video Clipper** in Apify Console
3. **Add the YouTube video URL** you want to clip
4. **Specify your clips** with start and end timestamps
5. **Click "Start"** and wait for the clips to be processed

## üöÄ Usage

To run the actor, provide the following input:
*   **YouTube Video URL**: The URL of the video you want to clip.
*   **Clips to Extract**: A JSON array defining the `name`, `start` time, and `end` time for each clip.

The actor is designed for maximum reliability and cost-efficiency. It automatically downloads the best available video quality and uses a high-performance "stream copy" method to create clips. This process avoids re-encoding the video, which significantly reduces CPU usage and lowers the cost of each run.

### Example Input
```json
{
  "videoUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
  "clips": [
    { "name": "clip_1", "start": "00:01:15", "end": "00:01:25" },
    { "name": "clip_2", "start": "00:02:40", "end": "00:02:50" }
  ]
}
```

### Resource Configuration

For most use cases, this actor is designed to be lightweight. To manage costs effectively, we recommend the following default resource allocation in your Actor settings:

-   **Memory:** 1024 MB (1 GB)
-   **Compute Units (CUs):** 0.5 CU

This configuration is sufficient for processing most videos. For very long source videos (over an hour), you may need to increase the memory to 2048 MB.

## üîº Input sample

The input requires a YouTube video URL and an array of clips with timestamps:

```json
{
  "videoUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
  "clips": [
    {
      "name": "intro_clip",
      "start": "00:00:05",
      "end": "00:00:15"
    },
    {
      "name": "highlight_moment",
      "start": "00:01:30",
      "end": "00:01:45"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Input Parameters:**
- **videoUrl**: The YouTube video URL to process
- **clips**: Array of clips with name, start time, and end time
- **proxy**: Optional proxy configuration for blocked regions
- **useCookies**: Optional boolean to enable cookie usage (required if using cookies)
- **cookies**: Optional YouTube cookies for private/restricted videos
- **maxRetries**: Number of retry attempts (default: 3)

Go to the input tab for a full explanation of the JSON input format.

## üîΩ Output sample

Each processed clip returns detailed information including direct download URLs:

```json
{
  "name": "intro_clip",
  "description": "Clip from 00:00:05 to 00:00:15",
  "startTime": "00:00:05",
  "endTime": "00:00:15",
  "url": "https://api.apify.com/v2/key-value-stores/.../clip_video.mp4",

  "processingTime": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
  "failed": false,
  "charged": true
}
```

The clips are stored in Apify's key-value store and accessible via direct URLs for immediate use.
