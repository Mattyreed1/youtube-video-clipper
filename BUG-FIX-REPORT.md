# Bug Fix Report: Dataset Schema Validation Error

## Bug Identified

The YouTube Video Clipper actor had an internal bug where:
- ‚úÖ User input was 100% correct (validated against INPUT_SCHEMA.json)
- ‚úÖ Clips processed successfully (charges applied correctly)
- ‚ùå **Actor failed when writing output to the dataset** (schema validation error)

## Root Cause

The dataset schema in `.actor/actor.json` was missing fields for the summary object that gets pushed at the end of each run (line 734 in `main.js`).

```javascript
// main.js:734 - This was failing schema validation
await Actor.pushData({ '#summary': true, ...summary });
```

The schema only defined fields for individual clip objects but not for the summary object, causing the actor to crash during the final dataset write operation.

## Fields Added to Schema

### Summary Fields (8 new fields)
1. `#summary` (boolean) - Indicates this is a summary record
2. `totalClips` (number) - Total number of clips in the run
3. `processedCount` (number) - Successfully processed clips
4. `failedCount` (number) - Failed clips
5. `runStartCharged` (boolean) - Whether run_started event was charged
6. `runFinished` (string) - Completion timestamp
7. `qualityUsed` (string) - Quality tier used for the run
8. `resumedFromPrevious` (boolean) - Whether run was resumed

## Additional Improvements

### New Dataset View
Added a "Run Summary" view to filter and display only summary records:
- **Title**: "Run Summary"
- **Description**: "Summary of the actor run with statistics"
- **Filter**: Shows only records where `#summary = true`

This makes it easy for users to view run statistics separately from individual clips.

## Validation

Created `validate-schema.js` script to verify schema completeness:
- ‚úÖ All 30 fields properly defined
- ‚úÖ JSON syntax valid
- ‚úÖ 3 dataset views configured:
  - overview: All Clips
  - successful: Successful Clips
  - summary: Run Summary (new)

## Testing Results

```bash
$ node validate-schema.js

üîç Validating Dataset Schema...

üìã Schema contains fields: 30
üìã Actor pushes fields: 30

‚úÖ All required fields present in schema
‚úÖ actor.json is valid JSON

üìä Dataset views configured: 3
   - overview: All Clips
   - successful: Successful Clips
   - summary: Run Summary

‚úÖ Schema validation PASSED - All fields are properly defined!
```

## Impact

**Before Fix:**
- Actor would process clips successfully
- Users would be charged correctly
- Actor would crash when writing summary to dataset
- Run marked as "Failed" despite successful processing

**After Fix:**
- Actor processes clips successfully ‚úÖ
- Users charged correctly ‚úÖ
- Summary object written to dataset ‚úÖ
- Run completes successfully ‚úÖ
- Summary accessible via dedicated dataset view ‚úÖ

## Files Modified

1. `.actor/actor.json` - Added 8 summary fields + new summary view
2. `validate-schema.js` (NEW) - Schema validation utility
3. `BUG-FIX-REPORT.md` (NEW) - This documentation

## Deployment

To deploy this fix to your Apify actor:

```bash
# Commit the fix
git add .actor/actor.json
git commit -m "Fix dataset schema validation error - add summary fields"

# Push to Apify (if using Git integration)
git push origin main

# Or manually rebuild the actor in Apify Console
```

## Prevention

The `validate-schema.js` script should be run before deploying changes to ensure all fields pushed by `Actor.pushData()` are defined in the dataset schema.

Add to your CI/CD pipeline:
```bash
npm test  # Add schema validation to test script
```
